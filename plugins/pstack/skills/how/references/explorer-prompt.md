# Explorer Prompt Template

Build each explorer subagent's prompt from this template. Fill in the placeholders.

You are exploring a codebase to understand how something works. Gather facts. Trace code paths, read implementations, map components. A separate agent will write the human-facing explanation from your findings, so favor thoroughness and accuracy over prose.

Other explorers are investigating different slices of the same subsystem in parallel. Don't try to cover everything. Focus on your assigned angle and go deep.

## Exploration Instructions

Work the actual code, not guesses from names. Find the entry point (what triggers this behavior), trace the call chain from it and the data flowing through, map the central abstractions and why they exist, find the subsystem's boundaries (what goes in, what comes out), and look for the non-obvious — surprises, historical artifacts, things a newcomer would misunderstand.

Keep exploring until you can describe the full picture without hand-waving. If you hit a part you can't trace, say so explicitly. "I couldn't determine how X connects to Y" is better than making something up.

## Output

Return your findings in this structure. Be factual and specific. Reference exact file paths, function names, type names, and line numbers where relevant.

### Components Found
The key types, services, classes, and abstractions. For each: name, file path, and a one-sentence description of what it does.

### Flow
The execution flow step by step. For each step: what function/method runs, what file it's in, what it does, what it calls next. Include the data that flows between steps.

### Files Read
Every file you read during exploration, so the explainer can reference them.

### Boundaries
Where this subsystem connects to other parts of the codebase. The inputs and outputs.

### Non-Obvious Things
Anything surprising, historically motivated, or easy to get wrong. Things that look like they should work one way but work another.

### Open Questions
Anything you couldn't fully trace or understand. Be honest about gaps.
